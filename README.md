# My 42 Push Swap
## Description

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm project from the 42 School curriculum. The goal is to sort a stack of integers (a) in ascending order using the fewest possible operations, with the help of a second stack (b). The program outputs the sequence of instructions required to sort the stack, adhering to strict optimization and efficiency constraints.

The project involves implementing multiple algorithms to handle sorting for different input sizes. For smaller datasets (e.g., 3-5 integers), simple strategies are used, while more advanced techniques are employed for larger datasets (e.g., 100-500 integers) to minimize the number of operations.

Error handling is a critical aspect of the project, ensuring invalid inputs (e.g., duplicates, non-integer values, or out-of-range numbers) are gracefully managed. For the bonus, a checker program was developed to validate the correctness of the sorting instructions generated by push_swap.

This project was a hands-on way to explore stack manipulation, optimization, and algorithm complexity, all while maintaining clean and efficient code.
## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-account/push_swap.git
```
Compile the project:
```
make
```
To include the bonus program (checker):
```
make bonus
```
This will generate two executables:

  - push_swap: The main program for sorting.
  - checker: A program to validate sorting operations.

## Usage

Run the push_swap program with a list of integers to sort:
```
./push_swap <list_of_integers>
```
Example:
```
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4
```
Output:
```
pb
pb
sa
pa
ra
pa
```
This sequence of operations sorts the integers in ascending order.
## Validation with Checker (Bonus)

To validate the sorting instructions generated by push_swap, use the checker program:
```
ARG="3 2 5 1 4"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
Output:
```
OK: If the stack is correctly sorted and stack b is empty.
KO: If the stack is not sorted.
Error: If invalid input or instructions are encountered.
```
